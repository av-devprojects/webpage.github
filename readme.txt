This project showcases my journey as a front-end developer, highlighting my skills, background, and ongoing work.

## ✨ Features

- Smooth section transitions using JavaScript
- Clean, responsive design built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Font Awesome

## 📁 Project Structure

- `index.html` — Main structure of the website  
- `stylesheet.css` — Styling and layout  
- `script.js` — Logic for toggling sections  
- `README.md` — You're reading it!

## 🔧 How It Works

Each section (About, Skills, etc.) is hidden or revealed using JavaScript when a user clicks the corresponding button. The active section becomes visible with smooth animation for a clean user experience.

## 📌 Notes
